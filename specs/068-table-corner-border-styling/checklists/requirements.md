# Specification Quality Checklist: Consistent DataTable Corner & Border Styling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No clarifications were needed: the user's request maps directly onto reasonable, industry-standard defaults (rounded header corners as the existing majority style, borderless outer edge, per-row bottom divider), all captured in the Assumptions section.
- This spec is closely related to `specs/067-datatable-header-border-consistency`, whose prior `/speckit-analyze` run found two unresolved gaps (an outer border still present on `app/configure/ConfigureOrderClientPage.tsx` and on 6 empty-state wrappers in `FulfillmentsTab.tsx`/`PurchasesTab.tsx`). This spec's FR-007–FR-009 and edge cases explicitly cover those cases (outlier tables, empty/loading states) so `/speckit-plan` can close them out under this feature if 067 is not reopened.
