## Notes

- The audit's "rebuild on shared ErrorMessage" recommendation for this page was investigated and explicitly declined — documented in Edge Cases and FR-006 — since ErrorMessage's shape doesn't fit a full-page 403 landing.
- This is a single-page, single-file feature scoped to 2 confirmed color-token defects (dark-mode support, off-brand button color).
